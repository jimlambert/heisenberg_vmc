This repo implements a variational quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that optimizes a variational anstaz using Stochastic Reconfiguration. The wavefunction anstaz
is based on the Gutzwiller projection of the solution of the quadratic pairing Hamiltonian. Details of the algorithm can be found in "Quantum Monte Carlo Approaches for Correlated Systems" 
by Becca and Sorella.
